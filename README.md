# StableDiffusionTools

> **Note:** This repository is "vibe coded." All tools and extensions herein were generated with the assistance of Artificial Intelligence/LLMs. Expect experimental features and high entropy.

**Sasig69/StableDiffusionTools** is a collection of experimental extensions and utilities designed specifically for [Stable Diffusion WebUI Forge](https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge).

These tools are built to enhance the Forge workflow, filling gaps with lightweight, AI-conceived solutions.

## ✨ Features

* **Forge Native:** optimized specifically for the resource management and Gradio backend of SD WebUI Forge.
* **Vibe Coded:** Built rapidly using AI assistance to solve immediate workflow annoyances.
* **Lightweight:** Minimal dependencies to keep your Forge instance fast.
* **Workflow Enhancements:** (Add specific tools here as you build them, e.g., *Prompt Randomizers, Quick Resolution Switchers, Latent Modifiers*).

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

To use these tools, you must have **Stable Diffusion WebUI Forge** installed.
* [Link to Forge Repository](https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge)

## 📥 Installation

1.  **Open your Terminal/Command Prompt** and navigate to your Forge extensions directory:
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/stable-diffusion-webui-forge/extensions
    ```

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Sasig69/StableDiffusionTools.git](https://github.com/Sasig69/StableDiffusionTools.git)
    ```

3.  **Restart Forge:**
    Reload your WebUI or restart the console to ensure the new scripts are compiled and loaded.

## 🚀 Usage

Once installed, the tools will appear in the relevant sections of the Forge interface (usually under the **Extensions** tab, or as new accordions in the **txt2img/img2img** tabs depending on the specific tool).

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

* **Experimental Nature:** As a "vibe coded" project, these tools are generated by AI. While they are tested for functionality, edge cases may cause errors.
* **Use at Your Own Risk:** Always ensure you have backups of your workflows or configurations before extensively using new experimental extensions.
